# Microsoft Graph - One API to Rule them All

## Abstract
> The Microsoft Graph, formerly named the Unified API prior to it’s GA release in late 2015, is Microsoft’s single endpoint developers can use to build custom applications. This API gives you access to a great many services that  Microsoft has to offer. The Microsoft Graph enables access to your email, calendar and contacts within Office 365. Developers can use the API to access files within a user’s OneDrive or interact with their OneNote notebooks. In this session you will learn how the Microsoft Graph has been implemented, how to write the code to first authenticate with Azure AD to obtain a single token and then read and write to the different services with the API!
